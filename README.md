# Autohotkey script for Apple keyboards

An autohotkey script to emulate OSX behavior with an Apple keyboard.

This script is based on the work of [Jonathan Str√∂bele (stroebjo)](https://github.com/stroebjo).  
The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/stroebjo/autohotkey-windows-mac-keyboard).

It add support for:

- Natural scrolling
- Move to trash (Command-Delete)
- Empty Trash (Command-Shift-Delete)

This script has been tested on a french MacBook Air keyboard. Feel free to contribute to support a wider range of configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before you use this script, you will need to use a proper keyboard layout profile on Windows to cover the basic character mappings.

You can create your own using [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator). For more informations, you can read this article on the [Apple support website](https://support.apple.com/us-us/HT5636)
